- **Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, and Multiple)**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstract Base Classes**
- **Special methods (`__str__`, `__add__`, etc.)**
- **Class and static methods**
- **Duck typing**
- **Protected methods**

The system includes animals, employees, enclosures, and a zoo environment with aging, health monitoring, and task simulation.
